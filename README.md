# Flask Deployment: Housing Prediction ML Model

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to create and deploy a machine learning model to predict housing prices using features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and the age of the house. This model is designed to deliver price predictions and can aid potential buyers and real estate professionals in making well-informed decisions.

### Data Sources

Simulated housing data: A dataset containing various attributes related to housing prices, including the number of bedrooms, square footage, year built, and price.

### Tools

- Python
- Flask

### Model Development and Training
The model was built using Python's scikit-learn linear regression model. The model was trained using the housing dataset and saved as a pickle file.

### Model Deployment

The model was deployed using Flask and a simple web interface was created to allow users to input housing attributes and receive pricing predictions.
